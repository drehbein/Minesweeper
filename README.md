Instructions:
Minesweeper is a puzzle game where players explore a grid, attempt to identify empty cells without digging up a mine. Left click to reveal a cell. (No pressure, first one's a freebie!) cells without mines are either blank or have a number, denoting how many mines are in the eight adjacent cells. If you suspect a mine's location, shift+click to flag it. This prevents accidentally revealing a mine. To remove a flag, shift-click it. Once all empty cells are identified, you win! But watch out. Revealing a mine, is an instant loss!

Default minesweeper difficulties are
  - Beginner: 8x8 or 9x9 with 10 mines
  - Intermediate: 16x16 with 40 mines
  - Expert: 16x30 with 99 mines
