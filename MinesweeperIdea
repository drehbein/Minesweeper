Minesweeper ideas:

Game state could be a dimension and a series of [area] digits 1-4.
- 0-7 from 3 binary digits: [0=safe 1=bomb][0=hidden 1=revealed][0=unflagged 1=flagged]
- Starts all 0s and 4s.
- 6 means game is lost.
- Cannot reach 7 or 3

Can create a global or profile-based displays to show various analyses.

Can incorporate predictive modeling to calculate chance of success based on the current game state (also global or profile-based).
